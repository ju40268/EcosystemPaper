By mapping the graph containing all relevant publications of members in an international collaboration network: COLLNET, we infer the structural mechanisms that govern the topology of this social system. The structure of the network affects the information available to individuals, and their opportunities to collaborate. The structure of the network also affects the overall flow of information, and the nature of the scientific community. We present a number of measures of both the macro- (whole-network) and micro- (actor-centered) structure of collaboration, and apply these to COLLNET. We find that this scientific community displays many aspects of a “small-world,” and is somewhat vulnerable to disruption should major figures become inactive. We also find inequality in the roles played by individuals in the network. The inequalities, however, do not create a closed and isolated “core” or elite."

 abstract = {Three measures of actors' network centrality are derived from an elementary rocess model of social influence. The measures are closely related to, and cast new light on, widely used measures of actors' centrality; for example, the essential social organization of status that has been assumed by Hubbell, Bonacich, Coleman, and Burt appears as a deducible outcome of this social influence process. Unlike previous measures, which have been viewed as competing alternatives, the present measures are complementary and, in their juxtaposition, provide for a rich description of social structure. The complementary indicates a degree of theoretical unification in the work on network centrality that was heretofore unsuspected.},

This paper moves a step in that direction by assessing the performance of four centrality models under a variety of known and controlled situations. It begins by examining the assumptions underlying each model, as well as its behavior in a community influence network. It then assesses the robustness and sensitivity of each model under conditions of random and systematic variation introduced into this network."

    abstract = "Identity theft, fraud, and abuse are problems affecting the entire society. Identity theft is often a “gateway” crime, as criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath are often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press, fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are unstructured. In order to analyze identity theft data, this research proposes an approach which involves the novel collection of online news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach pre-processes the raw text and extracts semi-structured information automatically, using text mining techniques. This paper presents statistical analysis of behavioral patterns and resources used by thieves and fraudsters to commit identity theft, including the identity attributes commonly linked to identity crimes, resources thieves employ to conduct identity crimes, and temporal patterns of criminal behavior. Furthermore, the automatically extracted information is validated against manually investigated news stories. Analyses of these results increase empirical understanding of identity threat behaviors, offer early warning signs of identity theft, and thwart future identity theft crimes."

        abstract = { Researchers typically label acts as “white-collar” based on the respectable status of the offender (populist perspective) or on the characteristics of the offense (patrician perspective). However, some crimes, such as identity theft are not easily classified into either of these categories. The current study is designed to contextualize previous research and to situate the crime of identity theft within these two broad perspectives of white-collar crime. To do this, 59 identity thieves incarcerated in federal prisons were interviewed to offer the offenders’ perspectives on existing research describing characteristics of thieves and the techniques they employ to complete their crimes. Results show that identity thieves are a diverse group in terms of demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, and social class), employment, and criminal histories. They employed a variety of methods to both acquire information and convert it to cash. The most common methods of acquiring information were to buy it from others or to steal it from mailboxes or trashcans. They also used numerous methods to convert these identities into valuable goods, which included accessing existing accounts, applying for new credit, and obtaining loans. Thus, the findings show that identity theft is difficult to classify as white-collar crime. }

    abstract = "Although the crime of identity theft has garnered a great deal of media attention, relatively little empirical research existed on the prevalence of the crime, its clearance rate by arrest, or the demographic characteristics of the victims and the identifiable offenders. The purpose of this article is to expand the knowledge of this growing crime. Using data from a large municipal police department located in Florida as a database, the findings suggested that the number of reported incidents of identity theft appeared to be growing at a greater rate than other theft-related offenses and the clearance rate for identity theft appeared to be declining. The typical apprehended offender was African American, female, unemployed, working alone, and was unknown to the victims, who tended to be White and male."

    abstract = { Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to extend recent work aimed at applying routine activity theory to crimes in which the victim and offender never come into physical proximity. To that end, relationships between individuals' online routines and identity theft victimization were examined. Method: Data from a subsample of 5,985 respondents from the 2008 to 2009 British Crime Survey were analyzed. Utilizing binary logistic regression, the relationships between individuals' online routine activities (e.g., banking, shopping, downloading), individual characteristics (e.g., gender, age, employment), and perceived risk of victimization on identity theft victimization were assessed. Results: The results suggest that individuals who use the Internet for banking and/or e-mailing/instant messaging are about 50 percent more likely to be victims of identity theft than others. Similarly, online shopping and downloading behaviors increased victimization risk by about 30 percent. Males, older persons, and those with higher incomes were also more likely to experience victimization, as were those who perceived themselves to be at greater risk of victimization. Conclusions: Although the routine activity approach was originally written to account for direct-contact offenses, it appears that the perspective also has utility in explaining crimes at a distance. Further research should continue to explore the online and offline routines that increase individuals' risks of identity theft victimization. }

    abstract = { Routine activity theory predicts that changes in legitimate opportunity structures (e.g., technology) can increase the convergence of motivated offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardianship. The Internet has fundamentally changed consumer practices and has simultaneously expanded opportunities for cyber-fraudsters to target online consumers. The authors draw on routine activity theory and consumer behavior research to understand how personal characteristics and online routines increase people’s exposure to motivated offenders. Using a representative sample of 922 adults from a statewide survey in Florida, the results of the regression models are consistent with prior research in that sociodemographic characteristics shape routine online activity (e.g., spending time online and making online purchases). Furthermore, indicators of routine online activity fully mediate the effect of sociodemographic characteristics on the likelihood of being targeted for fraud online. These findings support the routine activity perspective and provide a theoretically informed direction for situational crime prevention in a largely unexplored consumer context. }

Increased variety and volume of attacks is inevitable given the desire of financially and criminally-motivated actors to obtain personal and confidential information, as highlighted in this paper. We describe how the Routine Activity Theory can be applied to mitigate these risks by reducing the opportunities for cyber crime to occur, making cyber crime more difficult to commit and by increasing the risks of detection and punishment associated with committing cyber crime. Potential research questions are also identified."
